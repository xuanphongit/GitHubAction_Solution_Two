# GitHub Actions Environment Variable Management

A robust system for managing environment variables across multiple environments using GitHub Actions. This project provides a secure and automated way to handle configuration variables and secrets across different deployment environments.

## Features

- üîÑ **Multi-Environment Support**: Load variables from multiple environments (smoke, smoke2, smoke3, smoke4, smoke5)
- üîí **Secure Secret Management**: Integration with Azure Key Vault for secure secret handling
- üìù **Flexible Configuration**: Support for both XML and placeholder-based configurations
- üîÑ **Automated Workflow**: Streamlined process for variable loading, merging, and configuration updates
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation throughout the process

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Azure subscription with Key Vault
- Required secrets and variables:
  - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
  - `KEY_VAULT_NAME`
  - `GH_PAT` (for repository operations)

## Environment Setup

### GitHub Environments
The system supports the following environments:
- smoke
- smoke2
- smoke3
- smoke4
- smoke5
- production

### Required Permissions
- GitHub Actions workflow permissions
- Azure Key Vault access
- Repository access

## Usage

### 1. Configure Environments
Set up your environment variables in GitHub:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to Environments
3. Create environments (smoke, smoke2, etc.)
4. Add required variables to each environment

### 2. Configure Azure Key Vault
1. Create an Azure Key Vault
2. Add required secrets
3. Configure access policies
4. Add Azure credentials to GitHub secrets

### 3. Run the Workflow
The workflow can be triggered manually through GitHub Actions:
1. Navigate to Actions tab
2. Select "Load Environment Variables"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Workflow Process

1. **Load Variables**
   - Loads variables from all configured environments
   - Exports variables to environment context
   - Handles missing or empty variables gracefully

2. **Merge Configurations**
   - Combines variables from different environments
   - Resolves conflicts based on environment priority
   - Creates a unified variable set

3. **Update Configurations**
   - Replaces placeholders in web.config and web2.config
   - Supports both XML and #{placeholder}# formats
   - Maintains file structure and formatting

4. **Secret Management**
   - Retrieves secrets from Azure Key Vault
   - Applies secrets to configurations
   - Handles missing or inaccessible secrets gracefully

## Configuration Files

### web.config and web2.config
Example configuration:
```xml
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="APIENDPOINT" value="#{APIENDPOINT}#" />
    <add key="ConnectionString" value="#{DATABASECONNECTION}#" />
    <add key="Environment" value="#{Environment}#" />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

### replace.sh
Script for replacing placeholders in configuration files.

## Dependencies

### GitHub Actions
- actions/checkout@v4
- actions/upload-artifact@v4
- actions/download-artifact@v4
- azure/login@v1

### System Tools
- jq
- Azure CLI
- PowerShell 7+
- Bash

## Security Considerations

- Secrets are stored in Azure Key Vault
- Environment variables are properly scoped
- Access is controlled through permissions
- Sensitive data is handled securely
